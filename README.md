# Creek Landscape Unreal Engine Project

## Summary 

This Unreal Engine 5 Project is an winter and spring photorealistic environment developed to further improve outdoor nature environment setup. This project features automatic landscape materials and detailed photorealistic materials (through the integrative use of Quixel Bridge). Auto landscape materials are programmed such that certain materials appear on different slopes and parts of the landscape to accurately imitate natural environments in real life. For example, steep areas of the terrain are given a rock or cliff texture. The project also focuses on outdoor lighting tools present in Unreal Engine such as directional light, sky atmosphere, skylight, exponential height fog, and the post process volume.
